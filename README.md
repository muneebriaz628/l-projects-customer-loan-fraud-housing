Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Dataset: Titanic dataset (or Airbnb Listings)

Process:

Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Visualized categorical variables using bar plots

Histograms for numerical features

Correlation heatmap

Outcome: Key insights about survival rate and feature distributions

Task 2: Text Sentiment Analysis
Dataset: IMDB Reviews

Process:

Preprocessed text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Converted text into TF-IDF vectors

Trained Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models

Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score calculated

Outcome: Model predicts sentiment with good accuracy

Task 3: Fraud Detection System
Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Process:

Dealt with imbalanced data using undersampling

Trained Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models

Built command-line test interface

Outcome: Model effectively classifies fraud with high recall

Task 4: House Price Prediction
Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset

Process:

Normalized numerical data

Implemented Linear Regression from scratch

Used Random Forest & XGBoost for comparison

Visualized feature importance

Evaluation: Compared RMSE and RÂ²

Outcome: XGBoost performed best with lowest RMSE
